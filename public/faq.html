        <strong class='question'>Is CBD kombucha legal?</strong>
        <p class='answer'>
          Yes. The 2018 Farm Bill notably differentiated hemp from other cannabis plants and made it legal 
          at the federal level. CBD is derived from industrial hemp - not marijuana - and all Calibrate CBD 
          Kombucha beverages comply with the legal limit defined in section 10113 of the Farm Bill which states 
          that hemp cannot contain more than 0.3 percent THC.

        <strong class='question'>Do you have to be 21 to buy or consume Calibrate CBD Kombucha?</strong>        
        <p class='answer'>
          No. There are no age restrictions on hemp-derived CBD because it does not have psychoactive 
          properties. CBD is accessible to people of all ages. Furthermore, many animal lovers are successfully 
          administering CBD to their pets. We haven’t yet introduced CBD products to Calibrate’s bunny sidekick, 
          but current research shows it would be safe to do so.

        <strong class='question'>Can I drink Calibrate before work? </strong>          
        <p class='answer'>
          Yes. We recommend the [white label] kombucha for daytime consumption, particularly near the beginning 
          of the day. This single compound formulation will best support a relaxed attitude and relieve the stress 
          and anxiety often associated with a hectic work environment. The less reactive we are on the job, the 
          better we are able to listen, perform, and serve.

        <strong class='question'>Will I feel high or stoned after drinking Calibrate?</strong>          
        <p class='answer'>
          You will not feel a marijuana-like “high” from Calibrate CBD Kombucha. The [white label] formula 
          contains no THC whatsoever and is the right choice for people who want to avoid even minimal exposure 
          to a psychoactive compound. The [black label] formula does contain trace amounts of THC, and people who 
          are very sensitive to THC may feel some level of intoxication.

        <strong class='question'>What am I supposed to feel then? How do I know if it’s working?</strong>
        <p class='answer'>
          Developing an appreciation for CBD requires a reframing of expectations. Calibrate CBD Kombucha does not 
          deliver the same lift as marijuana. Instead, tune in to what you don’t feel after consuming it. Specifically, 
          feel for an absence of pain, stress, anxiety, inflammation, insomnia, etc. Instead of getting high to 
          temporarily mask how terrible you feel, think of CBD as a healthy, sustainable tool you can use to not feel 
          so terrible in the first place.

        <strong class='question'> How long does it take for the effects to kick in, and how long do they last?</strong>
        <p class='answer'>
          This depends on body chemistry and other factors like weight, but generally speaking you should feel 
          the effects in 15-45 minutes. Calibrate CBD Kombucha is crafted with high quality and highly bioavailable 
          CBD, so rapid absorption and activation in the body is common. That said, we stand by the suggestion on our 
          bottles to wait up to 60 minutes after your first dose to properly gauge your reaction. Speaking generally 
          again, effects last for about four hours.

        <strong class='question'>If I open the bottle and don’t drink it all, will the CBD go bad?</strong>        
        <p class='answer'>
          No. The CBD used in Calibrate has a shelf life of ~6 months in sealed container after being opened, 
          but it is very important to keep the beverage refrigerated. Calibrate is a live, raw, probiotic drink. 
          This potion is perishable! CBD is prone to degradation if exposed over time to light, heat, and air. 
          Calibrate is offered in amber bottles to better protect the beverage from UV radiation, but it’s up to 
          you to keep it cool.

        <strong class='question'> Do I need to shake the bottle to make sure the CBD is evenly mixed?</strong>        
        <p class='answer'> 
          No. Calibrate is crafted with a liquid-compatible CBD that disperses evenly without shaking or mixing. 
          However, Calibrate is also fermented beverage that leans heavily on whole plant ingredients, so you may see 
          naturally occurring particles settle to the bottom from yeasts, fruits, herbs, etc. We recommend gently 
          inverting the bottle once before drinking.

      <section class='q-and-a' id='q9'>
        <strong class='question'>How effective is Calibrate for pain relief? </strong>
        <p class='answer'>
          We suggest the [black label] kombucha for people managing more severe pain or inflammation. This 
          botanically complete formulation features a full spectrum of cannabinoids and is more effective than 
          isolated CBD for pain relief. Calibrate [black label] features CBD created by a whole plant infusion 
          method for a comprehensive entourage effect. It includes the cannabinoids CBN and CBG as well as all 
          terpenes and amino acids. CBN and CBG both contain anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and pain relieving 
          properties. They are also both sedatives, so [black label] can double as an effective sleep aid.

        <strong class='question'>Where can I find Calibrate CBD Kombucha?</strong>        
        <p class='answer'>
          You’ll need to pay attention! Calibrate is a small-batch, handcrafted, community-oriented solution to 
          modern ailments. We’ve made a conscious choice to offer our potions through pop-ups around town so that we 
          can connect and educate on a meaningful level. This kombucha isn’t mass produced. Each batch is treated with 
          meticulous care, strengthened with organic, local ingredients from California farmers markets and gardens, 
          and then presented to the people to balance their systems. Supplies will only last for 2-3 hours during our 
          sidewalk (or lake!) pop-ups, so we recommend subscribing to get alerts about our temporary locations.
